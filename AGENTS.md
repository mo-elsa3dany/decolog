# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds all app code: `App.tsx` for UI/logic, `db.ts` for Dexie schema, `storage.ts` for data helpers, and `assets/` for static media.
- `public/` stores static files served as-is; `dist/` is generated by builds.
- Root config: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.cjs`, `postcss.config.cjs`, and TypeScript configs (`tsconfig*.json`).
- Entry points: `main.tsx` bootstraps React into `index.html`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build` — type-check via `tsc -b` then produce production bundle in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built bundle locally for validation.
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint across the repo using the flat config in `eslint.config.js`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React function components; prefer hooks and typed props/state.
- Style: follow ESLint config; fix findings or justify disables inline. Indent with 2 spaces; use single quotes; favor const and early returns.
- Components and hooks: `PascalCase` for components, `useCamelCase` for hooks, `camelCase` for variables/functions. Keep files small and focused.
- Assets: place shared media in `src/assets/`; keep imports relative within `src/`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test suite is present yet; add unit tests when introducing logic-heavy helpers (e.g., calculations in `storage.ts`). Mirror file structure under a future `src/__tests__/` and name files `*.test.ts`.
- Prefer lightweight React testing; validate data helpers with pure TS tests. Ensure commands remain scriptable in CI.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages in history are short, imperative summaries (e.g., “Add diver profile module”); follow that style and scope commits narrowly.
- PRs should describe intent, key changes, and user impact; link issues when relevant. Include screenshots/GIFs for UI-visible changes and note any data migrations.
- Confirm `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before requesting review; mention coverage of manual checks (e.g., add/edit/delete dive flow, PWA install, PDF export).
